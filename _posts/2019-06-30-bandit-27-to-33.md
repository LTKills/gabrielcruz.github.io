[Over the Wire](http://overthewire.org/) has some interesting security challenges ([wargames](overthewire.org/wargames/)). In this post I give some insights on the last levels of [Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). The purpose of this post is not to spoil (although complete solutions can be found at the very end of the article), but rather to show some hints to help those of you that are stuck in a specific challenge.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
