[Over the Wire](http://overthewire.org/) has some interesting security challenges (called [wargames](overthewire.org/wargames/)). In this post I give some insights on the last levels of [Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/), the introductory wargame at Over the Wire. The purpose of this post is not to spoil (although complete solutions can be found at the very end of the article), but rather to show some hints to help those of you that are stuck in a specific level. I will not include previous levels here because most of them are already covered [here](https://bresleveloper.blogspot.com/2018/05/overthewire-bandit-walkthrough-just.html).

Don't read all the hints at once. Try to take a look at each hint separetly, go back to the challenge and try to go on by yourself. If you feel you need a little bit more help, come back and read another hint.


### Hints 26 -> 27


So assuming you successfully logged in level 26 the next password should be quite straightforward:

1. Figure out what the file `bandit27-do` does.







<!--space between hints and spoilers -->






## Appendix: Full Spoilers (WARNING)


This section is not supposed to explain what is going on, it just describes the steps used to obtain the passwords. Use it with responsibility.


### Spoilers 26 -> 27
Use the file `bandit27-do`, which executes what is passed to it as the user bandit27, to cat `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`. Full command is `./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`.

### Spoilers  27 -> 28
Make a new directory in `/tmp` with `mkdir`, navigate to it using `cd` and clone the git repo (in this case `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo`). The password is in `repo/README`.

### Spoilers 28 -> 29
Make a new directory in `/tmp` with `mkdir`, navigate to it using `cd` and clone the git repo (in this case `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo`). Use `git log` to find a commit where the data leak is present (`186a1038cc54d1358d42d468cdc8e3cc28a93fcb`) then checkout to it (`git checkout 186a1038cc54d1358d42d468cdc8e3cc28a93fcb`). The password is in this commit's version of `/repo/README.md`.

### Spoilers 29 -> 30
Make a new directory in `/tmp` with `mkdir`, navigate to it using `cd` and clone the git repo (in this case `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo`). List all remote branches with `git branch --all`, fetch the `dev` branch (`git fetch origin dev`), pull it (`git pull dev`) and checkout to it (`git checkout dev`). The password is in `repo/README.md`.

### Spoilers 30 -> 31
Make a new directory in `/tmp` with `mkdir`, navigate to it using `cd` and clone the git repo (in this case `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo`). List tags (`git tag`). The password is in the `secret` tag's annotation (`git show secret`).

### Spoilers 31 -> 32
Make a new directory in `/tmp` with `mkdir`, navigate to it using `cd` and clone the git repo (in this case `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo`). Create the file `key.txt` inside the repository (`touch key.txt`) and fill it with the text "May I come in?" (`echo "May I come in?" > key.txt`). Add the file to the staging area, the area that goes into the next commit. As all the files ending with `.txt` are being igored by `gitignore` we need either to remove that line from `gitignore` or to force add the file using `git add -f key.txt`. Commit (`git commit -m "Any message really"`) and push (`git push`). The password is returned after the push is completed.

### Spoilers 32 -> 33
Type `$0` to obtain the regular (not the uppercase) shell. In the regular shell just `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33`


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
