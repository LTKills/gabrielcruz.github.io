[Over the Wire](http://overthewire.org/) has some interesting security challenges (called [wargames](overthewire.org/wargames/)). In this post I give some insights on the last levels of [Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/), the introductory wargame at Over the Wire. The purpose of this post is not to spoil (although complete solutions can be found at the very end of the article), but rather to show some hints to help those of you that are stuck in a specific level. I will not include previous levels here because most of them are already covered [here](https://bresleveloper.blogspot.com/2018/05/overthewire-bandit-walkthrough-just.html).

## Bandit 26 -> 27

So assuming you successfully logged in level 26 the next password should be quite straightforward:

1. What does the file `bandit27-do` do?


## Appendix: Full Spoilers

**Bandit 26 -> 27:** Use the file `bandit27-do`, which executes what is passed to it as the user bandit27, to cat `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`. Full command is `./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`.

**Bandit 27 -> 28:** Make a new directory in `/tmp`, navigate to it using `cd` and clone the git repo (in this case `git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo`). The password is in `repo/README`.

**Bandit 28 -> 29:** Make a new directory in `/tmp`, navigate to it and clone the git repo. Use `git log` to find a commit where the data leak is present (`186a1038cc54d1358d42d468cdc8e3cc28a93fcb`) then checkout to it (`git checkout 186a1038cc54d1358d42d468cdc8e3cc28a93fcb`). The password is in this commit's version of `/repo/README.md`.

**Bandit 29 -> 30:** Make a new directory in `/tmp`, navigate to it and clone the git repo. List all remote branches with `git branch --all`, fetch the `dev` branch (`git fetch origin dev`), pull it (`git pull dev`) and checkout to it (`git checkout dev`). The password is in `repo/README.md`

**Bandit 30 -> 31:**


{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
