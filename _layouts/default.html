				<h2>Little Gabriel is born</h2>

      <p>
        You should be thinking "<a href="reddit.com/r/whoosh">/r/whoosh</a> this dude refers to himself in the third person". I do apologize about that, couldn't find anything better to use as a title, <a href="#footer">let me know</a> if you have a better idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born in a very rainy day of 1998. Three months later we found out that mother had brain cancer, she died when I was five months old.

        Hold your tears! Hopefully, I had a pair of amazing grandparents who rose me: grandma was my mother and grandpa, my father. I had a pretty good life (lots of candy and cakes from grandma, lots of money for ice cream from grandpa). Love them both very much. Now you may shed your tears.

      <p>
        I wasn't a very social person while growing up. I have to admit today that I was a pretty strange and anti-social child, so, unlike years ago, I don't blame my peers for not talking to me back then (I didn't talk to them as well after all).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have a lot of memories of my childhood. I do remember some awful moments on school and dealing with some mean kids from my building, but I also remmember riding my bike with my brother and my grandpa, playing ball with grandpa and chatting with grandma. I'd say those family moments were the best memories I have.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I hold my grandparents in very high regard, I have to admit they weren't great in talking about sex stuff with me, which eventually led me to some very awkward situations. Once at school I asked the teacher about the "woman's penis", everybody laughed. I was a fairly nice student, and found myself continually improving in school, so I ended up liking it.
