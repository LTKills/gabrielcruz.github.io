I always find it hard to answer the question of "why do you want to work with us", or all the other variants of it like "why do you think you're a good addition to the company" in an honest way. I mean, people are always telling me they want me to be honest, yet, ironically enough, saying that is itself dishonest more often than not. They want me to say how great of a fit I am for them. They want me to *sell myself*.

There are two problems with this kind of thought: the first is that I also have the same question about the company. I mean, I don't know whether *you* are a great fit for *me*, or did you think I want to work with you just because I applied? No, me applying means I'm interested enough to talk to you, just like you are with me if you decide to call me in for an interview.

The second problem is related to this growing tendency of valuing selling skills. Selling is a con, and I think we can agree that a good con artist would always get the job, but that's exactly the opposite you want from someone you just hired (unless the job posting is "Professional Con Artist", obviously, but I haven't seen much of these out there recently).

In conclusion: I want to interview with you because I think you have a good
company culture, because you work with stuff that interest me, and because I'd
be working on something that ressonates with my values (see
