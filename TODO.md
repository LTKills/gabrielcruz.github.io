### Total Madness
- Concurrency
    - Locks
        - why do we need locks? (interrupts)
        - implement a simple lock (why does it not work?)
        - types of locks & yield
    - Threads
        - talk about atomic && compare&swap
    - Deadlocks
        - The keyboard
    - Async (executor?)
- Memory
    - allocating
- Filesystems
