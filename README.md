# gmcruz.github.io
Gabe's portfolio/blog website based on the [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) hugo theme.

Obs: when cloning also clone the hugo template (it's a git submodule) with
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Run it locally with `hugo serve --buildFuture`

Obs: add `publish = "false"` or `publish = "true"` to control publishing of posts.
